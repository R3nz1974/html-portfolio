My career, spanning from 2011 to 2023, has been marked by the successful execution of numerous procurement projects, where I proficiently assisted Commanding Officers, ensuring seamless project completion and adherence to regulatory standards. My extensive experience includes supervising Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and managing intricate payment processes, including the handling of Letters of Credit, liquidations, and efficient spreadsheet manipulation.</p>

<p>My educational background and continuous professional development have been integral to my success. Graduating as valedictorian in both elementary and high school, I pursued a Certificate in Marine Engineering from Colegio Dela Purisima Concepcion.

These qualifications have equipped me with a robust skill set that encompasses IT networking, hardware servicing, and comprehensive knowledge of procurement regulations and documentation.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have been recognized for my exemplary performance and leadership capabilities. I have been honored as the Best Instructor at TRADOC, PA in 2009 and named Enlisted Personnel of the Year by AFPPS in 2020. My roles have varied from Facilities Management and Admin NCO to First Sergeant and Payment NCO, each position reinforcing my ability to manage teams, streamline processes, and uphold the highest standards of operational efficiency.
